# Python+SQL Project

This project involves analyzing eCommerce sales data using Python and SQL to derive actionable insights and trends. The goal is to demonstrate data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization techniques to help businesses optimize their strategies, improve customer experiences, and drive sales growth. The analysis is performed on a dataset of eCommerce transactions, with the use of Python for data processing and SQL for efficient querying of relational databases.

Key Features:
SQL Data Extraction: SQL is used to extract, filter, and aggregate data from a relational database to support in-depth analysis.
Sales Analysis: Analysis of sales performance over time, segmentation by product categories, and identification of top-selling products.
Customer Insights: Exploration of customer purchasing behavior, repeat purchase rates, and identification of high-value customers.
Trend Analysis: Time-series analysis to uncover seasonal trends and identify potential sales opportunities.
Visualization: Use of Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to generate visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to support decision-making.
Product Recommendations: Basic recommendation engine development to suggest products to customers based on their purchasing history.

Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
SQL: PostgreSQL or MySQL for database management and querying.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
Database Schema:
The eCommerce data includes tables for:

Orders: Contains information on individual transactions (e.g., order ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, date, price).
Products: Contains product details (e.g., product ID, name, category, stock levels).
Customers: Information on customers (e.g., customer ID, demographics, purchase history).
Payments: Payment details for each transaction (e.g., payment method, amount).

Example Insights:
What products are the top performers in terms of sales?
Which customer segments are the most valuable?
What is the sales trend over time (e.g., daily, monthly)?
How effective are promotional campaigns based on customer purchasing behavior?
